Our team project aims to create an application for a book store.
In our application, there will be a book database storing information about books
and authors. We have 2 tables, one is for books, the other one is for authors.
There is one-to-many relationship between authors and books: One author can write
multiple books but one book can only be written by one author.

In our book table, there will be 6 columns: Book number # (this is the primary key for books),
Book Name, Year, Author, Summary and Actions.

In our author table, there will be 4 columns: Author number # (this is the primary key for authors),
Name, Author introduction and actions.
