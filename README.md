group work for misy350 class

Our team project aims to create an application for a book store.
In our application, there will be a book database storing information about books
and authors. We have 2 tables, one is for books, the other one is for authors.
There is one-to-many relationship between authors and books: One author can write
multiple books but one book can only be written by one author.

In our book table, there will be 6 columns: Book number # (this is the primary key for books),
Book Name, Year, Author, Summary and Actions.

In our author table, there will be 4 columns: Author number # (this is the primary key for authors),
Name, Author introduction and actions.  


In the README.md file, add a short description of your team project, in which you need to develop a similar web application as the demo SongBase app, such as movie database, book database, etc. You need to include the database design, such as how many tables, what the columns in each table, and what are the relationships among tables (you must have at least one one-to-many relationship between two tables). No need to code the database part for this assignment.
